# Debugging for DIY Arduino Turn Signal Bike Safety Vest

**Troubleshooting**

1. The WS2812B LED strip is made up of 5050 RGB LED lights which a smaller WS2812B LED driver is integrated. Any breakage/issues with a single LED would affect the rest of the LED.

2. The LED Strips can be cut and bent , but too much bending can break delicate components. 

3. Keep in mind to conceal any open wires and use weatherproof materials, e.g., IP67 Weatherproof Coated LED strip. And until you’re fully satisfied with the vest’s weatherproofing, avoid operating this LightVest in rainy conditions.

4. Be sure to check the working of the remote and gyroscope by commiting multiple trials.
