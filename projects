project 1 : electronic weighing machine
The purpose of this project is to make a weighing machine to measure the weight of electronic components , thus callibrated in grams
the callibration can be reset after each measurement 
components used :
Hardware components
Arduino UNO	
Arduino UNO
3Kg Load Cell
Standard LCD - 16x2 White on Blue	
Adafruit Standard LCD - 16x2 White on Blue
I2C LCD Module
Software apps and online services
Arduino IDE	
comments : coding is part is critical

project 2:Metal detector circuit
to make a simple metal detector using simple components and a LC loop
a copper loop with 140 turns is used . if the loop is near to a metal , current is induced in the loop , which results in an output from the proximity sensor and the buzzer is turned on.
Components Required
1 x TDA0161 Proximity Detector IC
2 x 47nF Capacitors (Ceramic Capacitor code 473)
1 x 1 KΩ Resistor (1/4 Watt)
1 x 330 Ω Resistor (1/4 Watt)
1 x 100 Ω Resistor (1/4 Watt)
1 x 5 KΩ Potentiometer
1 x 2N2222A (NPN Transistor)
1 x 5V Buzzer
Coil (copper wire of 26 – 30 AWG is taken and it is wound in to a coil of diamater 5 – 6 cm and 140 – 150 turns)
Additional Components (for LED)
1 x 220 Ω Resistor (1/4 Watt)
1 x 5mm LED
